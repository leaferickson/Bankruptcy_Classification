# Bankruptcy Classification

## Organization and Methodology
Data is in [Raw Data](https://github.com/leaferickson/Bankruptcy_Classification/tree/master/raw_data).

Data was then cleaned using the .py files in [Data Clean](https://github.com/leaferickson/Bankruptcy_Classification/tree/master/data_clean)

Initial exploratory analysis was then done in the [Exploratory](https://github.com/leaferickson/Bankruptcy_Classification/tree/master/exploratory) folder.

A [Minimum Viable Product](https://github.com/leaferickson/Bankruptcy_Classification/tree/master/MVP) was then developed to imitate a business setting

Next, the different models were tuned in [Model Tuning](https://github.com/leaferickson/Bankruptcy_Classification/tree/master/model_tuning)

Finally, a presentation of my results was given to my Metis colleagues [Presentation](https://github.com/leaferickson/Bankruptcy_Classification/tree/master/Presentation.pdf)
